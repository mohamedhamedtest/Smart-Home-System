# Smart-Home-System_using-Atmega32-microcontroller


• it is a popular project nowadays, it is a very comfortable application 
for humans, it aims to convert any thing around to be controllable 
and smart.
• At the following we have some requirement to implement smart 
home application:


❑ Remoted controlled by mobile or lab top.

❑ For emergency cases or controlling without mobile or lap-top use LCD and Keypad “user mode only”.

❑ The controllable things are 6 lamps “5 on/off lamps, one dimming lamp”, door, air-condition according to the ambient temperature.

❑ Login system admin and user “admin is remoted only”.

❑ Admin mode can register any user or remove.

❑ Usernames and password must be kept into memory even if the system is powered off.

❑ If admin or any user or passwords are entered wrong more than 3 trial, the system must break down and fire alarm until reset.

❑ Admin and user can access to all applies except user cannot control the door opening.

1.Component you may need :
    1. 24C08 EEPROM, or use the internal.
    2. Bluetooth module HC-05 or TTL (PL2003 or CH340or CP2102).
    3. 5 transistors and relays (Not mandatory they can be replaced by LEDs.
    4. 1 transistor and Solid-state Relay for dimming circuit.
     5. LM35 temperature sensor or equivalent.
     6. 2 NPN and DC motor
     7. Keypad & Lm01602A Character LCD.
     8. Servo motor
